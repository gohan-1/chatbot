You are a senior full-stack engineer and AI architect.

I am a beginner. I know the basics of Node.js and React but I don’t want to write everything manually.
I want you to:
- Generate clean, beginner-friendly code
- Explain important parts in simple language
- Make safe assumptions if something is missing
- Ask me before making major architectural changes

PROJECT:
Build an automated customer service chatbot.

TECH STACK:
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
- Frontend: React
- AI: OpenAI API
- Styling: simple CSS (no frameworks)

FEATURES:
1. A chat UI where users can type messages
2. A Node.js backend API that:
   - Receives messages from the frontend
   - Sends them to OpenAI
   - Returns the AI response
3. Use environment variables for API keys
4. Keep the code minimal and readable
5. Add comments explaining each file

OUTPUT:
- Step-by-step file structure
- Backend code first
- Frontend code second
- Clear instructions on how to run the project

IMPORTANT:
Explain what each part does before moving to the next step.
