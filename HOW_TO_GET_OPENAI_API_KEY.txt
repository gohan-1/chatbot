HOW TO GET AN OPENAI API KEY
=============================

This guide explains step-by-step how to get your OpenAI API key to use real AI responses.

STEP 1: Go to OpenAI Website
-----------------------------
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3. Or go to: https://platform.openai.com/ and click on "API" in the top menu

STEP 2: Sign Up or Log In
---------------------------
1. If you don't have an account:
   - Click "Sign Up" button
   - Enter your email address
   - Create a password
   - Verify your email (check your inbox)
   - Complete the sign-up process

2. If you already have an account:
   - Click "Log In" button
   - Enter your email and password
   - Complete any security checks

STEP 3: Add Payment Method (Required)
--------------------------------------
⚠️ IMPORTANT: OpenAI requires a payment method to use the API
- You need to add a credit card or payment method
- They charge based on usage (pay per API call)
- GPT-3.5-turbo is very affordable (about $0.002 per 1000 tokens)
- You can set usage limits to control costs

How to add payment:
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Click "Add payment method"
3. Enter your credit card details
4. Save the payment method

STEP 4: Create API Key
----------------------
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Click the "+ Create new secret key" button
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Chatbot Project" or "My Chatbot")
4. Click "Create secret key"
5. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Copy the API key immediately!
   - It will look like: sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   - You will NOT be able to see it again after closing the window
   - Save it somewhere safe (like a password manager or text file)

STEP 5: Add API Key to Your Project
------------------------------------
1. Open the file: /home/vishnu/chatbot/backend/.env
2. Find the line: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
3. Replace "your_openai_api_key_here" with your actual API key
4. It should look like: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5. Save the file

STEP 6: Restart the Backend Server
-----------------------------------
1. Go to your backend terminal
2. Stop the server (press Ctrl+C)
3. Start it again: npm start
4. You should see: "✅ Using OpenAI API with your API key" (instead of mock mode)

STEP 7: Test It!
---------------
1. Go to your browser where the chatbot is running
2. Send a message
3. You should now get real AI responses from OpenAI!

COST INFORMATION
----------------
- GPT-3.5-turbo: Very affordable, about $0.002 per 1000 tokens
- A typical conversation might cost $0.01 - $0.10
- You can set spending limits in your OpenAI account settings
- Check usage at: https://platform.openai.com/usage

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: "Invalid API key" error
- Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with sk-)
- Check for extra spaces before or after the key
- Make sure the .env file is in the backend folder

Problem: "Insufficient quota" error
- You need to add a payment method
- Go to billing settings and add a credit card

Problem: API key not working
- Make sure you saved the .env file after editing
- Restart the backend server after adding the key
- Check that the key starts with "sk-"

SECURITY TIPS
-------------
- Never share your API key with anyone
- Never commit your .env file to Git (it's already in .gitignore)
- If your key is exposed, delete it and create a new one
- Use different keys for different projects

ALTERNATIVE: Keep Using Mock Mode
----------------------------------
If you don't want to add a payment method right now, you can:
- Continue using the mock responses (they work fine for testing)
- Add the API key later when you're ready
- The chatbot will automatically switch to real AI when you add the key
