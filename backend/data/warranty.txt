Q: Can I get warranty service outside the country of purchase?

Q: Will the service be the same as in the country of purchase?
A: Except as noted, any warranty services rendered shall be in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of the warranty scheme of the country where you originally purchased the Relevant Mobile Product.
